        <p>The Percent solutions can be in the form of weight/volume percentage, volume/volume percentage or, weight/weight percentage. In each case, the concentration in percentage is calculated as the fraction of the volume or weight of the solute related to the total volume or weight of the solution. Not only for a solution where concentration needs to be expressed in volume percent (v/v%) when the solute is a liquid, but it is also applicable to the numerator in weight units and the denominator in volume units and called weight/volume percent. </p>
